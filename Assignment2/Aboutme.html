        I'm a student studying Computer science, in Robert Gordon University in Aberdeen,
        Scotland. I have completed my Seniour Secondary Education from India. The instit-
        ution from which I've completed my previous education is St. Joseph Juniour college
        Located in Kalamboli, Navi Mumbai.<br><br>

        I'm fascinated towards cooking, I like to make different dishes. Apart from it I also
        like play sports like Cricket, badminton and many more. From these sports I like to
        play Cricket.<br><br><br>

        As I was very eager to know the science behind the computer from childhood. So it is my
        dream to become a Software Engineer.
      </p>
      <p>I was born in Tarn Taran a small village located in punjab. And then after few years my
        family moved to Mumbai so basically my journey started from there I started my studies and
        I completed my SSC in the year 2017 and after two years that is in 2019 I completed my Senior
        Secondary Education. Along with it I also appeared few competative exams such as JEE and IELTS.
        <br><br>
        So once I was eligible to study abroad I discussed it with my family and finalised to go and study
        abrod. When it comes to study abroad United Kingdom is said to be the best destination so I
        finalised the Robert Gordon University for my further studies and opted for computer science.
        <br>
        The Robert Gordon University is well known for it's golden teaching framework, and also it's
        placement. I have learnt many different modules so far.
