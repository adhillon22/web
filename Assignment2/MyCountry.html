    <div class="ParagraphOfInfdia1"><p>India, officially the Republic of India (Hindi: Bhārat Gaṇarājya),
      is a country in South Asia. It is the second-most populous country,
      the seventh-largest country by area, and the most populous democracy in
      the world. Bounded by the Indian Ocean on the south, the Arabian Sea on
      the southwest, and the Bay of Bengal on the southeast, it shares land
      borders with Pakistan to the west; China, Nepal, and Bhutan to the
      north; and Bangladesh and Myanmar to the east. In the Indian Ocean,
      India is in the vicinity of Sri Lanka and the Maldives; its Andaman
      and Nicobar Islands share a maritime border with Thailand and Indonesia.</p>
      <p>India has been a secular federal republic since 1950, governed in a democratic
        parliamentary system. It is a pluralistic, multilingual and multi-ethnic society.
        India's population grew from 361 million in 1951 to 1,211 million in 2011.
        During the same time, its nominal per capita income increased from US$64 annually
        to US$1,498, and its literacy rate from 16.6% to 74%. From being a comparatively
        destitute country in 1951, India has become a fast-growing major economy, a
        hub for information technology services, with an expanding middle class. It
        has a space programme which includes several planned or completed extraterrestrial
        missions. Indian movies, music, and spiritual teachings play an increasing role
        in global culture. India has substantially reduced its rate of poverty,
        though at the cost of increasing economic inequality. India is a nuclear
        weapons state, which ranks high in military expenditure. It has disputes over
        Kashmir with its neighbours, Pakistan and China, unresolved since the mid-20th
        century. Among the socio-economic challenges India faces are gender inequality,
        child malnutrition, and rising levels of air pollution. India's land is
        megadiverse, with four biodiversity hotspots. Its forest cover comprises 21.4%
        of its area. India's wildlife,
        which has traditionally been viewed with tolerance
        in India's culture, is supported among these forests, and elsewhere, in protected
        habitats.</p>

        <p>Tourism in India is important for the country's economy and is growing rapidly.
          The World Travel and Tourism Council calculated that tourism generated ₹16.91
          lakh crore (US$240 billion) or 9.2% of India's GDP in 2018 and supported 42.673
          million jobs, 8.1% of its total employment. The sector is predicted to grow
          at an annual rate of 6.9% to ₹32.05 lakh crore (US$450 billion) by 2028
          (9.9% of GDP). In October 2015, India's medical tourism sector was estimated
          to be worth US$3 billion, and it is projected to grow to US$7–8 billion by 2020
          . In 2014, 184,298 foreign patients traveled to India to seek medical treatment.
        </p>
        <p>The Travel and Tourism Competitiveness Report 2019 ranked India 34th out of 140
          countries overall. India improved its ranking by 6 places over the 2017 report
          which was the greatest improvement among the top 25% of countries ranked. The
          report ranks the price competitiveness of India's tourism sector 13th out of
          140 countries. It mentions that India has quite good air transport infrastructur
          e (ranked 33rd), particularly given the country's stage of development, and
          reasonable ground and port infrastructure (ranked 28th). The country also scores
          high on natural resources (ranked 14th), and cultural resources and business travel
          (ranked 8th). However, some other aspects of its tourism infrastructure remain
          somewhat underdeveloped. The nation has many hotel rooms per capita by
          international comparison and low ATM penetration. The World Tourism Organizatio
          n reported that India's receipts from tourism during 2012 ranked 16th in the world,
          and 7th among Asian and Pacific countries.</p>
