      <p>Robert Gordon University, commonly called RGU, is a public university
        in the city of Aberdeen, Scotland. It became a university in 1992,
        and originated from an educational institution founded in the 18th
        century by Robert Gordon, a prosperous Aberdeen merchant, and various
        institutions which provided adult education and technical education in
        the 19th and early 20th centuries. It is one of two universities in the
        city (the other is the much older University of Aberdeen). RGU is a campus
        university and its single campus in Aberdeen is at Garthdee, in the south-west of the city.</p>

        <p>    The university awards degrees in a wide range of disciplines from BA/BSc to PhD,
          primarily in professional, technical, health and artistic disciplines and those
          most applicable to business and industry. A number of traditional academic degree
          programmes are also offered, such as in the social sciences. In addition, the
          university's academic and research staff produce research in a number of areas.</p>

        <div class="ParaUni1">
          <p> The International College (ICRGU) building is a modular pre-fabricated two-storey
            building situated at the rear of RGU:Sport. It was constructed in 2011 to provide
            additional teaching space for the "International College at RGU" (ICRGU). This is
            a partnership with the Navitas Group, an Australian company which
            provides courses of study in its own colleges and arranges for students to continue
            their studies to degree level at various partner institutions in several English-speaking
            countries. The temporary building housing ICRGU was constructed in 2011 and has teaching
            facilities for these 400 students along with the administration and staff offices for
            the programme; it is not used for mainstream university classes. The modular units from
            which it is constructed are finished in plastic-coated galvanised steel in a dark red
            colour. Parking is not provided for students using this building and Aberdeen City
            Council have given planning permission for it to stand for only five years. After
            this time, ICRGU will move into the Sir Ian Wood building.</p>
